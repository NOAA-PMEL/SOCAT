 * Implementing classes can populate the {@code itsSupportedUnits} variable
 * with a list of all the handled units. Note that they must all be in lower
 * case, and must also include the final output units. For example, we support
 * conversion of temperatures from degrees Kelvin, and the output units are in
 * degrees Celsius. Both must be in the list.
