# SocatUploadDashboard
The Upload Dashboard for SOCAT.

This is a GWT project with a war file target.
Configuration to build as an Eclipse project with GWT is checked in at this time.
There is also pom.xml files for maven, but these do not perform the GWT compile required for client-side pages.
This maven build can be imported in IntelliJ, then adding the GWT facet.
